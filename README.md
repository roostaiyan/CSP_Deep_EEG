# CSP_Deep_EEG
This source code is implemented using keras library based on "Automatic ocular artifacts removal in EEG using deep learning" paper just for academics purposes, though a complete match with this paper is not guaranteed. To run the code, please download dataset 1 of the BCI Competition IV available on http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/#datasets.

This project contains:
- Common Spatial Pattern for EEG Feature Extraction
- using Deep Stacked Sparse Autoencoders (Keras) for EEG Denoising
- Support Vector Machine for EEG Classification
